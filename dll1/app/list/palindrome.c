/*****************************************************************************
 ** dll1 extra credit program - the purpose of this program is to test your
 ** palindrome processing       skills at using linked lists to aid you in
 ** -------------------------   solving problems. You will be evaluated on:
 **
 ** 0. string to list: take input (from STDIN) and place one character in a
 **                    unique node constituting a linked list.
 **              NOTE: do not use arrays; build your linked list one char
 **                    at a time (until terminated by a newline).
 **
 ** 1. string to list: take input (from the command-line, if present) and
 **                    place one character in a unique node in a linked list.
 **              NOTE: command-line input would override prompting the user
 **                    for input via STDIN.
 **
 ** 2. process spaces: any spaces in the input are to be ignored (ie not 
 **                    manifested within nodes in the resulting linked list)
 **              NOTE: be sure your program accepts spaces, even if it will
 **                    only ignore them in the ultimate processing.
 **
 ** 3.     reverse it: reverse the list and store it as an additional list.
 **              NOTE: don't reinvent the wheel. Points will be awarded for
 **                    appropriately utilizing list operations in your 
 **                    solution to this problem.
 **
 ** 4.   compare them: do a node-by-node comparison of both lists in order
 **                    to determine whether the input (ignoring spaces) is
 **                    a palindrome or not.
 **              NOTE: comparison is done using lists
 **
 ** 5. display status: display a message indicating whether or not the 
 **                    input is a palindrome or not.
 **              NOTE: be sure to output the processed string (from the
 **                    list) along with its palindrome status.
 **
 ** 6.       comments: code must contain readable and informative comments
 **                    throughout explaining the process and rationale.
 **              NOTE: comments should be organized, just like code- be it
 **                    consistent indentation or custom comment blocks.
 **
 ** extra credit will be awarded based on your appropriate use of linked
 ** list function usage, correctness, and non-reinventing of wheels. It also
 ** wouldn't hurt to comment your code and ensure it is indented and readable.
